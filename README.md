# Use Case

This action enables you to automate running tests which need access to secrets in a secure manner for forks. Consider this open-source workflow:
* Your repository is forked and a PR is created
* For merging, the maintainers need to check whether the integration tests pass
  * Sadly, the integration tests need to access secrets - we can't run the integration tests in the context of the fork
  * By doing so, we would bleed the secrets into the fork
  * So, what do we do? :question:

## The solution

* :+1: A maintainer performs a code review - the code looks awesome!
* :label: The maintainer adds a label `run-integration-tests` to the PR
* The cron-triggered workflow using this action runs and picks up the new PR.
* :envelope: Since the label `run-integration-tests` is present, and there is no comment yet from action [comment-on-pr-action](https://github.com/didiladi/comment-on-pr-action), a event `trigger-integration-tests` is dispatched.
* :inbox_tray: There is a workflow in the upstream repository which is triggered by the event.
* :heavy_check_mark: It runs the integration tests and wites back the results to the PR. Of course, the tests succeed.
* :100: Now, the maintainer can merge the awesome PR

This repository contains the code for the action to dispatch the event in the scenario above.


To see a full working example of the workflow, please look at the [didiladi/mac-build-test](https://github.com/didiladi/mac-build-test) repository.

## Dispatch an event for pull requests with given label

Use this action to trigger another workflow for every PR which fulfills these criteria:
* The PR is open
* The PR contains a given label (can be configured)
* The PR does not contain a comment coming from the [didiladi/comment-on-pr-action](https://github.com/didiladi/comment-on-pr-action) github action


### Usage

Create a workflow triggered by a cron job:

```
name: Trigger Integration Tests for Forks

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'

jobs:
  trigger_workflow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: main
        uses: didiladi/trigger-workflow-for-pr-action@v1
        with:
          label: run-integration-tests
          dispatch-event: trigger-integration-tests
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          dispatch-token: ${{ secrets.DISPATCH_TOKEN }}
```

### Input variables

  * label:
    * required: true
    * description: the label which needs to be resent on the pull request
  * dispatch-event:
    * required: true
    * description: the the name of the event dispatched for each matching pull request
  * token:
    * required: true
    * description: the token (in most cases this is `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`)
  * dispatch-token:
    * required: true
    * description: the token used for dispatching the event. This is usually a PAT with the necessary permissions to dispatch the event. Sadly, `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` does not have the necessary permissions.
  * repository:
    * required: false
    * description: the respository to search for pull requests in the format `{owner}/{repo}`
  * comment-user:
    * required: true
    * description: the user who posts the comments on the PR. This might be github-actions[bot] int eh default case, but also a other user, or bot - depending on the PAT used for the [comment-on-pr-action](https://github.com/didiladi/comment-on-pr-action) action.
    * default: github-actions[bot]

### Output event meta data 

The following data is added to the event which is being dispatched:

* ref: 
  * data type: string
  * description: The ref the PR was created from. This is usually the name of the branch in the fork where the PR originated. This information is later used to check out the same code contained in the PR. 
* pr_number: 
  * data type: number
  * description: The number of the PR. This information is used to write back the comment to the PR.
* user: 
  * data type: string
  * description: The user who created the PR
* repo: 
  * data type: string
  * description: The name of the repository (fork)
* comment_prefix: 
  * data type: string
  * description: This generated string is used to determine, if the PR already contains a comment for the given label. Otherwise, the cron job would continously keep on creating comments.
